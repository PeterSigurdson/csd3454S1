Use substring handling to snip out each "Data Frame"
Put that data frame into a Text String Variable, suppose it is "address"
Assign to your DR (DataRecord)
DR.addressField = address
After you have assigned all data frames to your DR object,
you put the whole DR Object into the ArrayList object reference a1
a1.Add(DR)
